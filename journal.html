<p>
Welcome! This is my journal for Computer Science 1 in the school 2020-2021. Overall, I've had a great year so far, but if you want to see my thoughts each individual week, please feel free to scroll down. </p>

<p>May 13 (A Thursday) - I'm working on making my website more aesthetically pleasing. I redid a lot of the styling on my journal and projects pages, (as I hope is evident, because previously, they were not the best) and I uploaded my three major projects. I am trying to figure out how to make one of the gifs I am using on my main projects page loop infinitely, but other than that, I think I might be ready to move on to creating a new project. I want to create a gallery of my digital artwork, or perhaps a field of blooming flowers, each of which produces different sounds when clicked.</p>

<p>May 7 (A Friday) - I really want to add audio to my website. However, this is proving to be a challenge, as most of the files I downloaded, (from youtube or otherwise) are not playing. The only one I was successful in producing was, ironically, my original "tester" file; the Moonlight Sonata. It doesn't match the tone of my teddy bear project, and it makes the shop feel eerie, intimidating, and absolutely the opposite of what I am going for. In addition, I am not happy with the way my website looks. It feels unfinished, and uncoordiated, so I might change it and go for a more cohesive pastel landscapes look. I also think that I the projects I have don't look like they match the tone of my website either. I think that adding a background and music to some of them, (like the cheesecake chooser, for instance) would greatly benefit both the projects and my website as a whole.</p>
